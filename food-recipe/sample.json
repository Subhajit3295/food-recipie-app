Ensuring your meats reach the proper internal temperature not only guarantees food safety but also prevents overcooking, keeping them juicy and flavorful. Different meats require different temperatures—chicken should reach 165°F (75°C), while medium-rare steak is best at around 130°F (54°C). Investing in a reliable digital thermometer can help you cook with confidence and achieve perfect results every time.",
